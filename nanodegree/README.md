# Scala Essentials Nanodegree 

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/IntersysConsulting/scala-essentials-nanodegree](https://badges.gitter.im/IntersysConsulting/scala-essentials-nanodegree.svg)](https://gitter.im/IntersysConsulting/scala-essentials-nanodegree?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

## About this nanodegree

Scala has positioned itself as the de facto language for Data Engineering. Several of the major big data frameworks and 
toolkits for batch processing and streaming analytics are implemented in this language. Furthermore, Scala provides a 
highly expressive and strong type system on top of the JVM which facilitates the development and maintenance of 
complex software applications. This includes but is not limited to distributed computing, highly resilient web 
applications, streaming technologies, and real time machine learning serving APIs.

In this nanodegree, you will learn the basics of Scala programming as well as the most common best practices. 
You will get familiar with functional programming principles and understand the trade-offs between  traditional 
object-oriented and functional paradigms. A successful completion of this nanodegree will enable you to pursue more 
advanced topics in the big data practice and general software development with Scala.

## Who should apply

Consider the following prospectus profiles: 

* **Beginners** with basic programming skills and willing to learn Scala.
    * Object oriented programming notions are a nice to have.
    * Experience with at least one typed language (e.g., Java).  

* **IT professionals** interested in software and/or data engineering with Scala.
    * Understands basic programming concepts.
    * Previous coding experience is required.

* **Developers** willing to increase their current skill set.
    * Has experience developing with several programming language including dynamic and strongly typed.
    * Has a good notion of design patterns and software best practices.
    
* **Scala and Java programmers** with object-oriented background and willing to learn functional programming.
    * Has a solid understanding of the JVM.
    * Understands OO design patterns. 
    * Is aware of the paradigm shift that implies FP.
    
## Requirements

Prospectus students must:

* Have their own hardware with the following minimum specs:
    * At least **4GB of RAM**. See the system requirements for IntelliJ [here](https://bit.ly/1IDJJ7h).
    * Be able to dedicate **at least 1 hour of individual learning** for each module (homework, readings, etc).
